  <h3>OPL Scandal </h3>
  <p> The OPL 245 Scandal, also known as the Malabu Oil Scandal, is one of the biggest corruption scandals in Nigeria's history. In 1998, the Nigerian government awarded the rights to explore OPL 245, one of the country's richest oil blocks, to a company called Malabu Oil and Gas. However, it later emerged that Malabu was controlled by former oil minister Dan Etete, who had awarded himself the rights while he was in office. The scandal involved a complex web of bribery, kickbacks, and shell companies, and several high-profile individuals and corporations were implicated, including former President Goodluck Jonathan, Shell, and Eni. The OPL 245 scandal has had lasting effects on Nigeria's oil sector, as it has highlighted the extent of corruption and lack of transparency in the industry, and has led to calls for greater accountability and reform.

  <h3>Pension Scam</h3>
  <p>The Nigerian pension scam is another example of how corruption has had lasting effects in the country. The scam, which involved the diversion of over N195 billion ($510 million) of pension funds by public officials and their accomplices, was uncovered in 2010. The funds were meant for retired civil servants, but were instead siphoned off by government officials and used to buy luxury properties, cars, and other assets. The pension scam has had lasting effects on Nigeria's pension system, as it has undermined public confidence in the system and made it more difficult for retired civil servants to access their entitlements

  <h3>Lagos- Ibadan Expressway</h3>
  <p>The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is one of Nigeria's most important road networks, connecting Lagos, the country's economic hub, to other parts of the country. However, the road has been in a state of disrepair for many years, with potholes, erosion, and congestion causing major delays and accidents. The poor state of the road has been attributed to corruption and mismanagement, as funds allocated for its repair and maintenance have been embezzled by government officials and contractors. The lasting effects of corruption on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway are evident in the daily struggles of commuters and motorists who use the road, as well as the economic impact on businesses that rely on the road for transportation of goods and services.
